            Co-administration of Dexmedetomidine with anesthetics, sedatives,
            hypnotics, and opioids is likely to lead to an enhancement of
            effects. Specific studies have confirmed these effects with
            sevoflurane, isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam. No
            pharmacokinetic interactions between dexmedetomidine and isoflurane,
            propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam have been demonstrated. However,
            due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, when coadministered
            with Dexmedetomidine, a reduction in dosage of Dexmedetomidine on
            the concomitant anesthetic, sedative, hypnotic or opioid may be
            required.

            In one study of 10 healthy volunteers, administration of
            Dexmedetomidine for 45 minutes at a plasma concentration of 1 (one)
            ng/mL resulted in no clinically meaningful increases in the
            magnitude or neuromuscular blockade associated with rocuronium
            administration.
