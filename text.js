export const indications = `
Intensive Care Unit sedation:
 Dexmedetomidine is indicated for sedation of initially intubated and mechanically ventilated patients during treatment in an intensive care setting.	
Procedural Sedation:
 Dexmedetomidine is indicated for sedation of non-intubated patients prior to and/or during surgical and other procedures.
`;

export const mechanismOfAction = `Dexmedetomidine is a relatively selective alpha -adrenergic agonist with sedative properties. Alpha selectivity is observed in animals following slow intravenous infusion of low and medium doses (10-300 mcg/kg). Both alpha and alpha activity is observed following slow intravenous infusion of high doses (≥1000 mcg/kg) or with rapid intravenous administration.
Onset of action:
Following infusion, Dexmedetomidine exhibits a rapid distribution phase with a half-life of about 6 minutes. Based on sedation scores, a loading infusion of one mcg/kg over a 10-minute period provides clinically effective onset of sedation generally within 10 to 15 minutes after the start of the infusion. If a loading dose is not used, time to onset of the sedative effect may be extended. The terminal elimination half-life of Dexmedetomidine is approximately 2 hours.
•	When a loading dose of 1 mcg/kg is administered for 10 minutes followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.3 mcg/kg/hr, an average Ramsay Sedation Score of 4 to 5 was achieved 20 to 25 minutes after initiating infusion in healthy normal subjects.
•	When administering a lower loading dose of 0.5 mcg/kg over 10 minutes followed by a lower maintenance infusion of 0.2 mcg/kg/hr, an average Ramsay Sedation Score of 3 to 4 was achieved after 15 to 33 minutes.
Elimination:
A mass balance study demonstrated that after nine days an average of 95% of the radioactivity, following intravenous administration of radiolabeled Dexmedetomidine, was recovered in the urine and 4% in the feces.
No unchanged Dexmedetomidine was detected in the urine.  Approximately 85% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was excreted within 24 hours after the infusion.
Fractionation of the radioactivity excreted in urine demonstrated that products of N-glucuronidation accounted for approximately 34% of the cumulative urinary excretion.`;

export const overdose = `The tolerability of Dexmedetomidine was noted in one study in which healthy subjects were administrated doses at and above the recommended dose of 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg/hr. the maximum blood concentration achieved in this study was approximately 13 times the upper boundary of the therapeutic range.
The most notable effects observed in two subjects who achieved the highest doses were first degree AV block and second degree heart block. No hemodynamic compromise was noted with the AV block and the heart block resolved spontaneously within one minute.

export const pharmacokineticProperty = `Dexmedetomidine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics in
 the dosage range of 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg/hr when administered
  by intravenous infusion for up to 24 hours.
  Following intravenous administration,
  Dexmedetomidine exhibits the following pharmacokinetic parameters:
  a rapid distribution phase with a distribution half-life (t½) of
  approximately 6 minutes; a terminal elimination half-life (t1/2)
  of approximately 2 hours; and steady-state volume of distribution
  (Vss) of approximately 118 liters. Clearance is estimated to be
  approximately 39 L/h. The mean body weight associated with this
  clearance estimate was 72 kg. The pharmacokinetic profile of
  Dexmedetomidine was not altered by age. There were no differences
  in the pharmacokinetics of Dexmedetomidine in young (18–40 years),
  middle age (41–65 years), and elderly (>65 years) subjects.

export const warningsAndPrecautions = `
  Drug Administration:
Due to the known pharmacological effects of Dexmedetomidine Hydrochloride, it should be administered only by a person skilled in the management of patients in ICU or operating room setting and the patients should be continuously monitored.
Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Sinus Arrest: Clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been associated with Dexmedetomidine Hydrochloride administration in young, healthy volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration, including rapid intravenous or bolus administration. Reports of hypotension and bradycardia have been associated with Dexmedetomidine Hydrochloride infusion.
If medical intervention is required, treatment may include decreasing or stopping the infusion of Dexmedetomidine Hydrochloride, increasing the rate of IV fluid administration, elevation of the lower extremities, and use of pressor agents. Because Dexmedetomidine Hydrochloride has the potential to augment bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli, clinicians should be prepared to intervene. The intravenous administration of anticholinergic agents (eg, atropine) should be considered to modify vagal tone. In clinical trials, atropine or glycopyrrolate were effective in the treatment of most episodes of Dexmedetomidine Hydrochloride -induced bradycardia.
  Transient Hypertension:
Transient Hypertension has been observed primarily during the loading dose in associated with the initial peripheral vasoconstrictive effect of Dexmedetomidine. Treatment of transient hypertension has generally not been necessary, although reduction of the loading infusion rate may be desired.
  Arousability:
Some patients receiving Dexmedetomidine have been observed to be arousable and alert when stimulated. This alone should not be considered as evidence of lack of efficacy in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms.
Withdrawal:
Intensive Care Unit Sedation: If Dexmedetomidine were to be administered for more than 24 hours and stopped abruptly, withdrawal symptoms similar to those reported for another alpha-2-adrenergic agent, clonidine may result. These symptoms include nervousness, agitation, and headaches, accompanied or followed by a rapid rise in blood pressure and elevated catecholamine concentrations in the plasma.
  Procedural Sedation:
Withdrawal symptoms were not seen after discontinuation of short term infusions of Dexmedetomidine (<6 hours).
  Hepatic Impairment:
Since Dexmedetomidine clearance decreases with severity of hepatic impairment, dose reduction should be considered in patients with impaired hepatic function.

export const useInSpecificPopulations = `
•	Pregnancy: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Dexmedetomidine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to fetus.
•	Lactation: It is unknown whether Dexmedetomidine HCL is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Dexmedetomidine HCL is administered to nursing women.
•	Labour & Delivery: The safety of Dexmedetomidine HCL during labour and delivery has not been studied. Therefore, Dexmedetomidine HCL is not recommended during labour and delivery, including cesarean section.
•	Pediatrics: There have been no clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy of Dexmedetomidine in pediatric patients below 18 years of age. Therefore, Dexmedetomidine should not be used in this population.
•	Geriatrics: Dexmedetomidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, case should be taken in dose selection in elderly patients, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.
•	Hepatic Impairment: since Dexmedetomidine clearance decreases with severity of hepatic impairment, dose reduction should be considered in patients with impaired hepatic function.
